- Search engine: Google Scholar
- Search term: Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Classification
- Notes: They used VVG16 (a CNN model) and a similar Data Set (also from Kaggle) of training and test data (X-Rays of chests) to detect pneumonia. The model predicted pneumonia with an average accuracy of 91.69%, sensitivity of 95.92%, and specificity of 100%.
